            <div>Simply create a new account via the login button on the top left and go into a game to save it. If the game iframe says restore old saves that means that it is either a unityweb or Godot game and your previous game saves are unsaveable and only by reseting your data for those games can you update it to our servers. I apologise for the extreme delay as this update had to include over 1000 new lines of code and a whole new backend. Unfortunately only 1 of the awaited games will be releasing soon (red laser) the other 3 will be released later.</div>
